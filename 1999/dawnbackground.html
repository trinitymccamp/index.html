    <h2>Dawn is known for a lot of things, mostly for his slothful lazyness. He grew up only knowing that for the most part, which fits perfectly with his job as an Online marketer for an online book store. He's room mates with his close friend Krafer, both of which live on the outskits of Swamplon city, near the borders of the north and west. Dawn has a soft spot for a lot of things, his favorit activities include sleeping and eating mostly.</h2>
